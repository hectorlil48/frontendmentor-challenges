## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I've learned how to use Javascript in a real world project. It wasn't easy but I've figured out how to prevent the page from refreshing and how to output a different message.



### Continued development

To get more practice with CSS and Javascript. I will be redoing this when I get more practice with bootstrap and JQuery.



### Useful resources

- [Mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Reading the Docs on CSS and Javascript helps.
- [StackoverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Great community to ask questions whenever you get stuck. Some one is always willing to help.
